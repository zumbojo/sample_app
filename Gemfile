# Had to twiddle some knobs to get rspec to run.  I am unsure what was effective and what was voodoo, but next time the problem occurs, try some permutation of:
# gem uninstall rspec rspec-rails
# gem install rspec
# gem install rspec-core
# gem install rspec-rails
# [updating the Gemfile]
# bundle install
# [shouting profanities at MacBook or house cat]
# bundle update
